# This file should be located in the root of your
# config repo that contains dotfiles and other configurations

# not sure where to pull pkg names from
apps:
  - vscode # or atom, etc
  - nvim # or vim, etc
  - msedge # or chrome, etc

# map app name -> respective config directory in repo
# app names could be stored in a db in strap itself
# which would be handy for making `apps` x-platform
#
# normal .*(whatever) configs will be inferred from the repo
# structure and linked into ~
config:
  vscode: vscode

# custom symlinks (just for overrides as far as I'm concerned)
link:
  - vscode/whatever
    - ~/.vscode/whatever
