# `strap`

<!-- fancy badges here -->

A simple-but-powerful utility to sync your machines' dotfiles and apps.

## Motivation

todo: write this section (about why the project was made)

draft bullet points:

- easier syncing configs (via diffs)
- boilerplate a whole machine (with apps), not just configs
- for fun! learning go, etc.
